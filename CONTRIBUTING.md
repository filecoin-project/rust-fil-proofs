# Contributing

Welcome, it is great that you found your way here. In order to make the best of all our time, we have gathered some notes 
below which we think can be helpful when contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this file.

## Coding Standards

- No compiler warnings.
- No [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) warnings.
- Minimize use of `unsafe` and justify usage in comments.
- Prefer `expect` with a good description to `unwrap`.
- Write unit tests in the same file.
- Format your code with `rustfmt`
- Code should compile on `stable` and `nightly`. If adding `nightly` only features they should be behind a flag.
- Write benchmarks for performance sensitive areas. We use [criterion.rs](https://github.com/japaric/criterion.rs).


## General Guidelines
- PRs require code owner approval to merge.
- Please scope PRs to areas in which you have expertise. This code is still close to research.
- Welcome contribution areas might include:
  - SNARKs
  - Proof-of-replication
  - Rust improvements
  - Optimizations
  - Documentation (expertise would require careful reading of the code)
  
## PR Merge Policy (Git topology)

### Allowed (white list)
 - Single fast-forward merge commit, with all internal commits squashed.
 - Non-fast-forward merge commit, with all internal commits squashed -- rebased to branch from the previous commit to master.
 - Non-fast-forward merge commit, with curated (as appropriate), linear, internal commits preserved -- rebased to branch from the previous commit to master.

### Disallowed (black list)
 - Non-rebased merge commits which branch from anywhere but the previous commit to master.
 - Merge commits whose internal history contains merge commits (except in rare circumstances).
 - Multiple fast-forward merge commits for a single PR.
 - Internal junk commits â€” (e.g. strings of WIP).
 
### In Practice
 - In general, please rebase PRs before merging.
 - To avoid having approvals dismissed by rebasing, authors may instead choose to:
   - First use GitHub's 'resolve conflicts' button;
   - Then merge with GitHub's 'squash and merge' button.

If automated conflict resolution is not possible, you will need to rebase and seek re-approval. In any event, please note the guidelines and prefer either a single commit or a usefully curated set of commits.
